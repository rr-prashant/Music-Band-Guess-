Kurt Donald Cobain (February 20, 1967 – c. April 5, 1994) was an American singer,  
songwriter, artist and musician. He was the frontman of the rock band Nirvana,     
serving as the band's guitarist, lead vocalist, and primary songwriter. Through    
his angst-fueled songwriting and anti-establishment persona, Cobain's compositions  
widened the thematic conventions of mainstream rock music. He was often heralded    
as a spokesman of Generation X and is considered to be one of the most influential  
musicians in the history of alternative rock.
