Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara; 5 September 1946 – 24 November 1991)    
was a British singer-songwriter, who was best known as the lead vocalist of 
the rock band Queen. Regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history  
of rock music, he was known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octave 
vocal range. Mercury defied the conventions of a rock frontman with his 
theatrical style, influencing the artistic direction of Queen.
